The application should access all data through stored procedures rather than direct SQL queries in the application code. This provides better security, performance, and maintainability.

Create a stored-procedures.sql file at the repository root containing all the stored procedures needed for the application's data access.

Key requirements for stored procedures:

- Use CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE syntax so the script can be run multiple times without errors
- Ensure every stored procedure called by the application code exists in the stored-procedures.sql file
- The application code should never construct dynamic SQL or access tables directly

The deployment script (deploy-infra/deploy.ps1) automatically imports the stored procedures using sqlcmd with Entra ID authentication. For manual execution, use sqlcmd with --authentication-method=ActiveDirectoryDefault.

Do not use Python scripts for executing SQL against the database. The sqlcmd tool handles GO batch separators natively and is the recommended approach for all database script execution.
