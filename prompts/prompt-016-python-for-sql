Use sqlcmd (the modern go-sqlcmd tool) for all database operations. Do not use Python scripts for SQL execution.

The deployment script (deploy-infra/deploy.ps1) handles all database operations automatically including schema import, managed identity user creation, role assignments, and stored procedure deployment.

For manual execution or troubleshooting, use sqlcmd with --authentication-method=ActiveDirectoryDefault for Entra ID authentication. The older -G flag is deprecated in the modern go-sqlcmd tool.

To install sqlcmd on Windows: winget install sqlcmd

The sqlcmd tool handles GO batch separators natively, which is essential for SQL Server scripts that contain multiple batches.
