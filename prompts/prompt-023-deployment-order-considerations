## Infrastructure vs Application Deployment Separation

There are two distinct deployment phases, each with its own automated PowerShell script.

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment

Run the infrastructure deployment script:

    .\deploy-infra\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup "rg-yourapp" -Location "eastus2"

This script handles everything automatically: Azure CLI validation, credential retrieval, resource group creation, Bicep deployment, SQL Server configuration, firewall rules, database schema import, stored procedures, managed identity permissions, and App Service settings.

At the end, the script saves a deployment context file (.deployment-context.json) containing all the resource names and configuration values needed for the next phase.

### Phase 2: Application Deployment

After infrastructure deployment completes, run the application deployment script with no parameters:

    .\deploy-app\deploy.ps1

The script automatically reads the deployment context file created by the infrastructure script, so you don't need to specify the resource group or web app name. It builds the .NET application, creates a deployment package, and deploys to Azure App Service.

### Seamless Deployment Flow

The two scripts are designed to work together without manual parameter entry between them. The deployment context file passes resource names and configuration values from infrastructure deployment to application deployment automatically.

### Bicep Guidelines

Use uniqueString(resourceGroup().id) to generate deterministic unique names for resources. Never use timestamps like utcNow() in variable declarations as this is not allowed in Bicep.

Key considerations for Bicep templates:

- The utcNow() function can only be used as a parameter default value, not in variable declarations
- Conditional module outputs must use null-safe operators (?. and ??) to prevent errors when optional modules are not deployed
- All resource names should be lowercase to comply with Azure naming requirements
- Do not configure diagnostic settings at the SQL Server level as categories like SQLSecurityAuditEvents are not supported - only configure diagnostics at the database level
